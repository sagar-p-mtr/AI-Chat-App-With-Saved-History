---

### 2. Data Privacy & Surveillance
**Question:**
In an increasingly connected world, how do we reconcile the benefits of data collection (personalized services, improved security, medical research) with fundamental privacy rights?

### 9. Gig Economy & Worker Rights
**Question:**
The gig economy offers flexibility but often lacks traditional employment protections like health insurance, paid leave, and job security. Are gig workers truly "independent contractors," or are they employees being misclassified to reduce company obligations? How should labor laws evolve to protect gig workers without eliminating the flexibility that attracts many to this model? What does the future of work look like?

---

## 🧬 Science & Medicine

### 10. Genetic Engineering Ethics
**Question:**
CRISPR and other gene-editing technologies offer unprecedented ability to eliminate genetic diseases, but also raise concerns about "designer babies," eugenics, and unforeseen consequences of modifying the human genome. Where should we draw ethical lines? Should parents be allowed to select traits like intelligence, athletic ability, or appearance? What international frameworks are needed to prevent misuse while enabling beneficial research?

---

### 11. Mental Health Crisis
**Question:**
Mental health issues, particularly depression and anxiety, are rising dramatically, especially among young people. What factors contribute to this crisis—social media, economic pressure, environmental concerns, or changing social structures? Why is mental healthcare often inaccessible or stigmatized? What systemic changes are needed in healthcare systems, workplaces, schools, and communities to address mental health with the same urgency as physical health?

---

### 12. Pandemic Preparedness
**Question:**
COVID-19 exposed significant weaknesses in global pandemic preparedness and response. What lessons should we learn about public health infrastructure, international cooperation, vaccine development and distribution, misinformation management, and balancing public safety with individual freedoms? How can we better prepare for future pandemics while addressing the economic and social disruption prevention measures cause?

---

## 🎨 Philosophy & Human Nature

### 13. Free Will vs. Determinism
**Question:**
Modern neuroscience suggests that our decisions may be determined by brain chemistry, genetics, and environment before we consciously "choose" them. If free will is an illusion, what are the implications for moral responsibility, criminal justice, personal achievement, and the meaning we assign to our lives? Can we reconcile scientific determinism with our subjective experience of making choices?

---

### 14. Meaning & Purpose in Modern Life
**Question:**
In an increasingly secular, individualistic society where traditional sources of meaning (religion, community, lifelong careers) are declining, where do people find purpose? Does the modern emphasis on personal happiness and self-actualization lead to fulfillment or existential anxiety? How do we create meaningful lives in a world that can feel overwhelming, disconnected, and uncertain?

---

### 15. Technology & Human Connection
**Question:**
Despite being more "connected" than ever through technology, many report feeling lonelier and more isolated. Is technology eroding our ability to form deep, meaningful relationships? What is lost when communication is mediated through screens—body language, emotional nuance, presence? How can we use technology to enhance rather than replace genuine human connection, and what boundaries should we set on digital interaction?

---

## 🏛️ Justice & Governance

### 16. Criminal Justice Reform
**Question:**
The criminal justice system in many countries faces criticism for racial bias, harsh sentencing, high recidivism rates, and prioritizing punishment over rehabilitation.
